# Cryptography

This document describes cryptography used by Charmed Spark K8s.

## Resource checksums

The three charms in the Charmed Spark solution: Spark History Server, Spark Integration Hub, and Kyuubi; all employ pinned revisions of the workload images they operate on. The Spark History Server and Kyuubi use different flavours of the [Charmed Spark Rock image](https://github.com/canonical/charmed-spark-rock/) whereas the Spark Integration Hub uses the [Spark Integration Hub Rock image](https://github.com/canonical/spark-integration-hub-rock).
The Spark K8s Bundle is a bundle of charms and relations necessary for preparing an end-to-end tested Spark cluster ready for use. The bundle also pins the revisions of all individual charms, and the revisions of the workload images used by those charms. In Terraform bundles, the pinning of workload images is done with a revision number, whereas in the YAML bundle, this is done with a SHA252 digest of the image.
All artifacts, that are bundled into Charmed Spark Rock image, Spark Client snap and Spark Integration Hub Rock image are verified against their MD5, SHA256 or SHA512 checksums after the download. The Spark8t Python library in the rock image is installed from the GitHub repository itself with the version pinned.

### LaunchPad

Distributions are built using private repositories only, hosted as part of the [SOSS namespace](https://launchpad.net/soss) to eventually integrate with Canonicalâ€™s standard process for fixing CVEs. Branches associated with releases are mirrored to a public repository, hosted in the [Data Platform namespace](https://launchpad.net/~data-platform) to provide the community with the patched source code.

### GitHub

All Charmed Spark artifacts are published and released programmatically using release pipelines implemented via GitHub Actions. Distributions are published as both GitHub and LaunchPad releases via the [central-uploader repository](https://github.com/canonical/central-uploader), while charms, snaps and rocks are published using the workflows of their respective repositories.

All repositories in GitHub are set up with branch protection rules, requiring:

* new commits to be merged to main branches via Pull-Request with at least 2 approvals from repository maintainers
* new commits to be signed (e.g. using GPG keys)
* developers to sign the [Canonical Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors)

## Encryption

The Spark8t Python library client authenticates to the underlying Kubernetes cluster using a variety of authentication mechanisms (depending upon how the underlying K8s server is configured) with the use of the Kubeconfig file. The communication between K8s and Spark8t is always encrypted by default with authentication enforced. Since Spark Client snap is a wrapper around this library, the communication between the snap and the K8s cluster is also authenticated and encrypted.

The Spark8t Python library stores Spark properties as Kubernetes Secrets because these properties may contain credentials like database password, AWS S3 access key, secret keys, etc. These are encrypted both at rest and in transit by default by the underlying K8s engine.

Spark History Server, Kyuubi, and Spark Integration Hub have capabilities to connect to S3 compliant cloud storage as an object storage backend, using the S3 Integrator charm, or to an Azure storage, using the Azure Storage Integrator charm . For providing encryption in transit, S3 and Azure endpoints should be configured to enable encryption and HTTPS support. 

The Kyuubi charm may use PostgreSQL to store the metadata and user/authentication information. The communication between the charm and the PostgreSQL can be encrypted using TLS certificates. 

The Kyuubi charm has capabilities to connect to Zookeeper for HA and service discovery features. The communication between Kyuubi and Zookeeper can be encrypted using TLS certificate. 

The Kyuubi charm exposes a JDBC compliant endpoint which can be connected using JDBC compliant clients, like Beeline. Encryption is currently not supported and it is planned for 25.04.

Spark uses RPC connections for the communication between driver and executors. To secure the communication. Spark provides capabilities to authenticate and encrypt the channels using shared secrets, that can be configured using dedicated [Spark properties](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html#ssl-configuration).

Encryption for Spark History Server is provided via integration with Traefik, allowing encrypted connections terminated at ingress-level. 

## Authentication

In the Charmed Spark solution, authentication mechanism exists at the following places:

1. Connection with Zookeeper
2. Connection with PostgreSQL
3. Connection with S3 
4. Connection with Azure Storage
5. Kyuubi Client <> Kyuubi Server connection
6. Connection with Kubernetes Substrate
7. Connection between Spark Driver and Executors
8. Spark History Server Web Interface
 
### Connection with Zookeeper

Kyuubi Server authenticates to Zookeeper using a hash digest mechanism using digested MD5 hashes of username and password. Usernames and passwords are exchanged using a databag of the relation between Kyuubi and ZooKeeper. These credentials are stored unencrypted in configuration files in the `/opt/kyuubi/conf` directory inside the Kyuubi workload container.

Clients need to connect to Zookeeper for service discovery and retrieving information about the list of healthy Kyuubi Servers. The connection to ZooKeeper for service discovery is currently unauthenticated, exposing the list of healthy Kyuubi servers stored in a dedicated ZooKeeper node publicly readable by everyone.

### Connection with PostgreSQL

Kyuubi Server authenticates to Postgres using username and password that are exchanged using relation data when the two applications are integrated. These credentials are stored by Kyuubi in configuration files in the directory `/opt/kyuubi/conf` inside the workload container. For more information, see the [Kyuubi official documentation](https://kyuubi.readthedocs.io/en/master/security/jdbc.html).

### Connection to Object Storages

Authentication is required for Spark Jobs, Spark History Server, and Kyuubi to connect to either S3 or Azure object storages. Credentials are stored in peer-relation data for S3 Integrator and in Juju secrets for the Azure Object storage, and they are communicated to other charms (Spark History Server, Integration Hub and Kyuubi) via relation databag. Integration Hub stores the credentials into Kubernetes Secrets to be made available for Spark Jobs. Driver and executors store configuration files (where credential information is stored) unencrypted in `/etc/spark8t/conf`. Kyuubi stores credentials in unencrypted configuration files in `/opt/spark/conf`, to be used to configure Spark Engine, and `/opt/kyuubi/conf`, to be used to configure the Kyuubi server. Spark History Server stores credentials in unencrypted configuration files in `/etc/spark/conf`.
 
### Connection between Spark Driver and Executors

Spark internally has a capability to use a shared secret based RPC authentication mechanism for connection between driver and executors to establish a secure channel. The authentication is not required, but can be enabled through dedicated [Spark properties](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html#encryption).

### Connection with Kubernetes Substrate

The connection between Charmed Spark and Kubernetes Substrate can be authenticated using various mechanisms like certificate based authentication, password based authentication, etc. which depends on how the underlying Kubernetes substrate is configured. 

### Kyuubi Client <> Kyuubi Server Connection

The Kyuubi Client (aka JDBC Client) can connect with the Kyuubi Server endpoint (aka JDBC endpoint) using a pair of username and password provided in the query. Kyuubi charm internally implements this authentication by storing the list of users and their passwords stored as plaintext in a PostgreSQL database . For more information about the Kyuubi client, see the [Kyuubi official documentation](https://kyuubi.readthedocs.io/en/master/client/index.html).

### Spark History Server Web Interface

The Spark History Server provides authentication integrated using the Canonical Identity Platform in combination with a custom design [servlet filter](https://code.launchpad.net/~data-platform/soss/+source/charmed-spark-servlet-filters/+git/charmed-spark-servlet-filters). This feature can be enabled by following the steps in the [History Server authorisation How-to guide](https://charmhub.io/spark-k8s-bundle/docs/h-history-server-authorization).

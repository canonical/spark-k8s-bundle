# 6. Using Apache Kyuubi

Apache Kyuubi is a gateway to serverless SQL running on Kubernetes, bridging the gap between Apache Spark as a data processing framework and a data lakehouse platform.

This hands-on tutorial stage aims to help you learn how to use Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s and become familiar with its available operations.

## Environment setup

We will use the same environment as the rest of the tutorial before. If you lack the resources in your system to proceed, you can do one of the following to free up used resources:

* Delete previously created Juju model with all deployed resources.
* Reset the Multipass virtual machine to the snapshot created at the end of the [environment setup](/t/13233) stage of this tutorial.
* Delete the existing Multipass VM and repeat the [environment setup](/t/13233) stage of this tutorial.

### Environment variables

At this step of the tutorial, you’ll need some environment variables that were set earlier during the environment setup stage.
If you’ve restarted the VM and lost those variables, refresh them by running the following commands:

```bash
export ACCESS_KEY=$(kubectl get secret -n minio-operator microk8s-user-1 -o jsonpath='{.data.CONSOLE_ACCESS_KEY}' | base64 -d)
export SECRET_KEY=$(kubectl get secret -n minio-operator microk8s-user-1 -o jsonpath='{.data.CONSOLE_SECRET_KEY}' | base64 -d)
export S3_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl get service minio -n minio-operator -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
```

## Initial setup

Let's create a fresh Juju model for the Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s experiments:

```bash
juju add-model lakehouse
```

To create our simple, minimal data lakehouse, we need an object storage.

Deploy and configure [S3-integrator](https://charmhub.io/s3-integrator) to use the object storage provided by the MinIO addon, run:

```shell
juju deploy s3-integrator --channel 1/stable
juju config s3-integrator bucket=lakehouse path="spark-events" endpoint=http://$S3_ENDPOINT
juju run s3-integrator/0 sync-s3-credentials access-key=$ACCESS_KEY secret-key=$SECRET_KEY
```

We will deploy the [Spark Integration Hub K8s charm](https://charmhub.io/spark-integration-hub-k8s) to manage integrations and configure service accounts on Kubernetes.

To deploy it and integrate with the object storage integrator:

```shell
juju deploy spark-integration-hub-k8s --channel 3/edge --trust integration-hub
juju integrate integration-hub s3-integrator
```

We also need a database to hold our users, using the [Charmed PostgreSQL K8s charm](https://charmhub.io/postgresql-k8s):

```shell
juju deploy postgresql-k8s --channel 14/stable --trust auth-db
```

Finally, to enable external clients to connect to our lakehouse, we need the [Data Integrator charm](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator):

```shell
juju deploy data-integrator --channel latest/stable --config database-name=test
```

We are now ready to deploy the Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s charm, and integrate it with the previous charms:

```shell
juju deploy kyuubi-k8s --channel 3.4/edge --trust --config expose-external=loadbalancer
juju integrate kyuubi-k8s integration-hub 
juju integrate kyuubi-k8s:auth-db auth-db
juju integrate kyuubi-k8s data-integrator
```

Check the list of charms that have been deployed and their statuses:

```shell
watch -c juju status --relations --color
```

Wait until the status to be active for each charm:

```text

## Access Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s

Get the JDBC endpoint and its credentials with the following command:

```shell
juju run data-integrator/0 get-credentials
```

The resulted output should look like the following:

```yaml
kyuubi:
  data: '{"database": "test", "external-node-connectivity": "true", "provided-secrets":
    "[\"mtls-cert\"]", "requested-secrets": "[\"username\", \"password\", \"tls\",
    \"tls-ca\", \"uris\", \"read-only-uris\"]"}'
  database: test
  endpoints: 10.64.140.43:10009
  password: 31rwWzk8wpnhoZvU
  tls: "False"
  uris: jdbc:hive2://10.64.140.43:10009/
  username: relation_id_15
  version: 1.10.2
ok: "True"
```

Make sure that the [spark-client snap](https://snapcraft.io/spark-client) is installed:

```shell
sudo snap install spark-client --channel=3.4/edge
```

Use the `spark-client.beeline` command to access the endpoint with a JDBC-compliant `beeline` client:

```shell
spark-client.beeline -u "jdbc:hive2://10.64.140.43:10009/" -n relation_id_15 -p 31rwWzk8wpnhoZvU
```

The client should welcome you with a prompt where you can run SQL queries.

## Enable encryption with TLS

TLS is enabled by integrating Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s with the [Self-signed certificates charm](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates).
This charm centralises TLS certificate management consistently and handles operations like providing, requesting, and renewing TLS certificates.

[note]
Avoid using self-signed TLS certificates for production environments.
Please refer to the [X.509 certificates post](https://charmhub.io/topics/security-with-x-509-certificates) for an overview of the TLS certificates Providers charms and some guidance on how to choose the right charm for your use case.
[/note]

Before enabling TLS on Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s, deploy the `self-signed-certificates` charm to use as a certificate provider:

```shell
juju deploy self-signed-certificates --config ca-common-name="Tutorial CA"
```

Wait for the charm to settle into an `active/idle` state, as shown by the `juju status`.

To enable TLS on Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s, integrate the `kyuubi-k8s` charm with the `self-signed-certificates` charm:

```shell
juju integrate kyuubi-k8s self-signed-certificates
```

After the charms settle into `active/idle` states, the Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s endpoint should now accept encrypted traffic.
Requesting the credentials again should now display the certificate:

```shell
juju run data-integrator/0 get-credentials
```

The resulted output should look like the following:

```
kyuubi:
  data: '{"database": "test", "external-node-connectivity": "true", "provided-secrets":
    "[\"mtls-cert\"]", "requested-secrets": "[\"username\", \"password\", \"tls\",
    \"tls-ca\", \"uris\", \"read-only-uris\"]"}'
  database: test
  endpoints: 10.64.140.43:10009
  password: 31rwWzk8wpnhoZvU
  tls: "True"
  tls-ca: |-

```

This can be tested by requesting the server certificate using `openssl` on the endpoint returned above:

```shell
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $(juju run data-integrator/0 get-credentials | yq ".kyuubi.endpoints") < /dev/null
```

To connect to Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s using the spark-client's bundled `beeline` client, import the certificate in the spark-client snap:

```shell
juju run data-integrator/0 get-credentials | yq ".kyuubi.tls-ca" > cert.pem
spark-client.import-certificate tutorial-cert cert.pem
```

Then, add `;ssl=true` to the JDBC endpoint you got from the data-integrator charm.

```shell
spark-client.beeline -u "jdbc:hive2://10.64.140.43:10009/;ssl=true" -n relation_id_15 -p 31rwWzk8wpnhoZvU
```

The client should welcome you once again with a prompt where you can run SQL queries.

Congratulations! You are now connected to Charmed Apache Kyuubi K8s using TLS.

# Wrapping Up

This section concludes the Tutorial by freeing up the resources used so far.

## Cleanup

First of all, let's destroy the Juju controller we bootstrapped for the tutorial.

```bash
juju destroy-controller --destroy-all-models --destroy-storage --force spark-tutorial
```

The `spark-streaming`, `history-server` and `cos` namespaces are automatically deleted when the corresponding models are destroyed. Let's also delete the `spark` K8s namespace. This will automatically clean up K8s resources within the namespace.

```bash
kubectl delete namespace cos
kubectl delete namespace history-server
kubectl delete namespace spark-streaming
kubectl delete namespace spark
```

Finally, the S3 bucket that was created can be removed using the AWS CLI as follows:

```bash
aws s3 rb  s3://spark-tutorial --force
```

## Going Further

Parts of this tutorial were originally covered in a talk at the Ubuntu Summit 2023, the recording of which is available [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu1ll7VRqbI).

This tutorial covers running Charmed Apache Spark locally using MicroK8s. Running Charmed Apache Spark in MicroK8s locally is limited by the amount of resources available locally. For a more robust deployment, it's also possible to run Charmed Apache Spark solution on AWS EKS. Please refer to [this how-to guide](/t/charmed-spark-k8s-documentation-how-to-setup-k8s-environment/11618) for guidance on deploying and configuring an AWS EKS cluster to run Charmed Apache Spark. Additionally, here is a video demonstration of running Charmed Apache Spark on top of AWS EKS at the [2023 Operator Day demo](https://github.com/deusebio/operator-day-2023-charmed-spark).

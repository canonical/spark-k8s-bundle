## Expose the Spark History server UI

### Without Ingress (MicroK8s only)

The Spark History server exposes a UI accessible at ```http://<spark-history-server-ip>:18080```. 

If you are running MicroK8s, you can directly expose it to the local network by enabling DNS

```bash
microk8s enable dns
```

and retrieve the Spark History server POD IP using

```bash
IP=$(kubectl get pod spark-history-server-k8s-0 -n spark --template '{{.status.podIP}}')
```

### With Ingress

The Spark History server can be exposed outside a K8s cluster by means of an ingress. This is the recommended way in production for any K8s distribution. Exposing Kubernetes services through an ingress generally requires the cloud provider/infrastrucutre to have an external load balancer integrated with the Kubernetes cluster. Most cloud providers (such as AWS, Google and Azure) provide this integration out-of-the-box. If you are running on MicroK8s, make sure that you have enabled `metallb`, as shown in the "How-To Setup K8s" userguide. 

Spark History server can be exposed outside of the K8s cluster using `traefik-k8s` charm. 
If COS is enabled, you can use the ingress already provided as part of the COS bundle. Otherwise, you can deploy one using 

```bash
juju deploy traefik-k8s --channel latest/candidate --trust
```

Then, relate with the Spark History server charm

```bash
juju relate traefik-k8s spark-history-server-k8s
```

After the charms settle down into `idle/active` states, fetch the URL of the Spark History server with 

```bash
juju run-action traefik-k8s/0 show-proxied-endpoints --wait
```

This should print a JSON with all the ingress endpoints exposed by the `traefik-k8s` charm. To also exposed the UI outside the local cloud network via a public domain or to enable TLS encryption, please refer to [this userguide](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/lets-encrypt-certificates-in-the-juju-ecosystem/8704) about integration of `traefik-k8s` with Route53 and Let's Encrypt (note that this is currently only supported on AWS EKS only).

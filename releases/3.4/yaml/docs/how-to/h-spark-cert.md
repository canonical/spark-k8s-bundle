# Support self-signed certificates in Apache Spark Client snap

The Apache Spark Client snap offers the possibility to submit jobs to a Kubernetes cluster with the `spark-submit` command. 

In some use cases, there is the need to use self-signed certificates to trust self-hosted services such as Ceph or many others. 
For this reason, we had a feature in the Apache Spark Client snap to add certificates in the Java truststore inside the snap to validate the desired service.

## Add certificate

To add a new certificate you can use the following command:

```bash
spark-client.import-certificate <CERTIFICATE_ALIAS> <CERTIFICATE_PATH>
```

where `<CERTIFICATE_ALIAS>` is the alias associated to the certificate and the `<CERTIFICATE_PATH>` is the path of the desired certificate. Please be sure that the path of the certificate is accessible by the Apache Spark Client snap.
